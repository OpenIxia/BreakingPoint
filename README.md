## BreakingPoint detail
Network testing with  [BreakingPoint®](https://www.ixiacom.com/products/network-security-testing-breakingpoint). By simulating real-world legitimate traffic, distributed denial of service (DDoS), exploits, malware, and fuzzing, BreakingPoint validates an organization’s security infrastructure, reduces the risk of network degradation by almost 80%, and increases attack readiness by nearly 70%. And with our new TrafficREWIND solution, you'll get even more realistic and high-fidelity validation by adding production network insight into BreakingPoint test traffic configuration

**NOTE**: We try to improve and extend the RESTAPI every release. The Python wrapper library is dynamically created based on the RESTAPIs available in a specific release version. Backwards compatibility will be maintained for the high level RESTAPI calls and the high level Python functions. To benefit from the latest API enhancements and bugfixes users should upgrade their BPS RESTAPI PYTHON Module to the corresponding wrapper from the branch. (Using a newer python wrapper library than the BPS framework might raise some issues as some functions expect the changes of the API made in the corresponding release.)
