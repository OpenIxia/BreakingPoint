## BreakingPoint detail
Network testing with  [BreakingPoint®](https://www.ixiacom.com/products/network-security-testing-breakingpoint). By simulating real-world legitimate traffic, distributed denial of service (DDoS), exploits, malware, and fuzzing, BreakingPoint validates an organization’s security infrastructure, reduces the risk of network degradation by almost 80%, and increases attack readiness by nearly 70%. And with our new TrafficREWIND solution, you'll get even more realistic and high-fidelity validation by adding production network insight into BreakingPoint test traffic configuration

**NOTE**: We try to improve and extend the RESTAPI every release. The Python wrapper library is dynamically created based on the RESTAPIs availlable in a specific release version. Backwords compatibility will be mantained fro the high level RESTAPI calls and the hign level Python functions. To benefit from the latest API enchacements anb bugfixes users should upgrade their PYTHON wrapper modules to the coresponding wrapper from the branch. (Using a newer python wrapper library might raise some issues as the some functions expected the chances of the API made in the coresponding release.)
